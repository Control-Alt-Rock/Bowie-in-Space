		<p class="element centered"><strong>Two weeks later, I began writing again.</strong></p>

			<div class="box centered">Some friends agreed to let me start a blog as part of their arts magazine. I called it <strong>Ketabkhan</strong>-it means book-reader in Persian. Six years was a long time to be in jail, but it's an entire era online. Writing on the internet itself had not changed, but reading - or, at least, getting things read - had altered dramatically. I'd been told how essential social networks had become while I'd been gone, and so I knew one thing: If I wanted to lure people to see my writing, I had to use social media now.</div>

		<div class="centered">So I tried to post a link to one of my stories on Facebook. Turns out Facebook didn't care much. It ended up looking like a boring classified ad. No description. No image. Nothing.</div>
	</div>
	<div style="float:left;width:49%">

		<div class="disappointing centered">It got three likes.</div>
		<div class="disappointing centered">Three!</div>
		<div class="disappointing centered">That was it.</div>

		<div class="centered">It became clear to me, right there, that things had changed. I was not equipped to play on this new turf - all my investment and effort had burned up. I was devastated.</div>

		<div class="centered"> Blogs were gold and bloggers were rock stars back in 2008 when I was arrested. At that point, and despite the fact the state was blocking access to my blog from inside Iran, I had an audience of around 20,000 people every day.</div>

		<span class="end centered"> Everybody I linked to would face a sudden and serious jump in traffic: I could empower or embarrass anyone I wanted.</span>
