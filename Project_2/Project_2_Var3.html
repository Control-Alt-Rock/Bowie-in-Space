	<p class="element centered"><strong>Two weeks later, I began writing again.</strong></p>

		<div class="box centered">Some friends agreed to let me start a blog as part of their arts magazine. I called it <strong>Ketabkhan</strong>-<em>it means book-reader in Persian.</em></div> 

	<div class="paragraph centered">Six years was a long time to be in jail, but it's an entire era online. Writing on the internet itself had not changed, but reading - or, at least, getting things read - had altered dramatically. I'd been told how essential social networks had become while I'd been gone, and so I knew one thing: If I wanted to lure people to see my writing, I had to use social media now.</div>

	<div class="centered">So I tried to post a link to one of my stories on Facebook. Turns out Facebook didn't care much. It ended up looking like a boring classified ad. </div>

		<ul>
			<li class="description">No description.</li>
			<li class="description">No image.</li> 
			<li class="description">Nothing.</li> 
		</ul>

	<div class="disappointing centered">It got three likes.</div>
	<div class="disappointing centered">Three!</div>
	<div class="disappointing centered">That was it.</div>

	<div class="below centered">It became clear to me, right there, that things had changed. I was not equipped to play on this new turf - all my investment and effort had burned up.</div>

	<h4>I was devastated.</h4>

	<div class="paragraph centered">Blogs were gold and bloggers were rock stars back in 2008 when I was arrested. At that point, and despite the fact the state was blocking access to my blog from inside Iran, I had an audience of around 20,000 people every day. </div>

	<div class="end centered"> <strong>Everybody I linked to would face a sudden and serious jump in traffic: I could empower or embarrass anyone I wanted.</strong> </div>
