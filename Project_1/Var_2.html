<p>Two weeks later, I began writing again. Some friends agreed to let me start a blog as part of their arts magazine. I called it Ketabkhan - it means book-reader in Persian.</p>
	<p><&nbsp>Six years was a long time to be in jail, but it's an entire era online. Writing on the internet itself had not changed, but reading - or, at least, getting things read - had altered dramatically. I'd been told how essential social networks had become while I'd been gone, and so I knew one thing: If I wanted to lure people to see my writing, I had to use social media now.</p>
<p>So I tried to post a link to one of my stories on Facebook. Turns out Facebook didn't care much. It ended up looking like a boring classified ad. No description. No image. </p>p>
<br />
	<p><strong>Nothing</strong>. It got three likes. <em>Three!</em> That was it.</p>
<p>It became clear to me, right there, that things had changed. I was not equipped to play on this new turf - all my investment and effort had burned up.</p>
	<p>I was devastated.</p>
<p>Blogs were <strong>gold</strong> and bloggers were rock stars back in 2008 when I was arrested. At that point, and despite the fact the state was blocking access to my blog from inside Iran, I had an audience of around 20,000 people every day. Everybody I linked to would face a sudden and serious jump in traffic: <em>I could empower or embarrass anyone I wanted.</em></p>
